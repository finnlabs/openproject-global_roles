Feature: No Module

  Scenario: Global Rights Modules do not exist as Project -> Settings -> Modules
    Given there is the global permission "glob_test" of the module "global"
    And there is 1 project with the following:
      | name       | test |
      | identifier | test |
    And I am already admin
    When I go to the members tab of the settings page for the project "test"
    Then I should not see "Global"
